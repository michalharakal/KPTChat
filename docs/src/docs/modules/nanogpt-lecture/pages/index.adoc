This is a fork based on project
from https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html["Andrej Karpathy, Neural Networks: Zero To Hero"]

See details on the original source.

== Intrduction

The main goal of this fork is to study and understand basic building blocks, so existing code can be modularized and
rebuild from scratch again in a different programming language. We are embarking on a detailed, step-by-step analysis of
Andrej Karpathy's insightful video. This journey will involve a deep dive into the concepts and methodologies presented
by Karpathy, a renowned figure in the field of artificial intelligence.

The purpose of this analysis is not just to understand the content of the video, but to dissect the techniques and ideas
presented, and explore how they can be applied in real-world scenarios, particularly in the development of advanced
language models like GPT.

Each step of my analysis will focus on a specific segment of the video, breaking down complex ideas into more
understandable parts. I'll be looking closely at the theoretical aspects, as well as any coding or practical
implementations demonstrated. This will include:

. *Introduction and Overview*: Understanding the context and objectives of Karpathy's presentation.
. *Key Concepts*: Delving into the core ideas and theories discussed in the video.
. *Technical Deep Dive*: Analyzing any code or algorithms presented, and exploring how they work.
. *Practical Applications*: Discussing how the concepts from the video can be applied in practical projects, especially in the context of GPT models.
. *Summary and Reflections*: Concluding with a summary of key takeaways and my personal reflections on the learning process.

This endeavor is not just a learning exercise, but also a tribute to the educational contribution of Andrej Karpathy to the AI community. I aim to make this analysis comprehensive and accessible, hoping it will serve as a valuable resource for anyone interested in AI and machine learning.

== Steps

* analysis - link:analysis.md[Learn about our Model Architecture]
* modularizing python scripts
* writing test suite to obtain golden standard, which will be used as reference comparison with other implementation
